This folder is to reproduce the results of continuous datasets. Each file is described as follows:

"Data Generation": In this file, we can generate continuous datasets.

"mixedcca" and "mixedcca-comptime": In these two files, we can run the MixedCCA algorithm and obtain its computation time. At the same time, we can generate the initial values that will be used in simulated tempering.

"ST_main": In this file, we can run our simulated tempering algorithm.


"rifle" and "rifle-time": In these two files, we can run the Rifle algorithm, and obtain its computation time.

"Comparison": In this file, we can compare the results for all algorithms in terms of error, TPR and TNR.
