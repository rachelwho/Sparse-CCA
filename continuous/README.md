This folder is to reproduce the results of continuous datasets. Each file functions as follows:

"Data Generation": In this file, we can generate continuous datasets.

"mixedcca" and "mixedcca-comptime": In this file, we can run MixedCCA algorithm and we can obtain the computation time for MixedCCA algorithm. At the same time, we can generate the initial values that can also be used in simulated tempering.

"ST_main": In this file, we can run our simulated tempering algorithm.


"rifle" and "rifle-time": In this file, we can run Rifle algorithm, and obtain the computation time for Rifle.

"Comparison": In this file, we can compare the results for all algorithms in terms of error, TPR and TNR.
