This folder is to reproduce the results of covid datasets. Each file functions as follows:

"Covid_data": the covid-19 data.

"pre_processing": In this file, we clean the covid datasets.

"mixedcca" : In this file, we run the MixedCCA algorithm. At the same time, we can generate the covariance matrix estimator that will be used in simulated tempering.

"covid": In this file, we can run our simulated tempering algorithm.
